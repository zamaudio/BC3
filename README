BlockCompiler3 (BC3)
====================

This copy of BC3 includes the changes from both of Matti's releases from 2008
and I modified the configuration to work with GNU/Linux.

Nothing has been altered significantly other than the realtime audio processing
has been removed (it only worked in MacOSX and Windows I think) and the config
has been changed for easy interoperation with GNU CLISP and GNU GCC.

Make sure you install GNU toolchain and GNU CLISP.

Go into Support directory and run the following command to compile
the lisp part into a package:

	clisp BC-COMPILE.lisp

Now you can run the example for direct C code DSP output:

	clisp example
