<br>




<h3>BC3LW version June 30,&nbsp;2008 for fresh installation
on Mac OSX (10.4&amp;10.5), Windows and LispWorks
5.0/5.1&nbsp;</h3>




<ol style="text-align: left;">




  <li>Install <a href="http://www.lispworks.com">LispWorks
Common Lisp</a>
Professional or Personal version as instructed on the web page.
LispWorks Personal Edition is a free version with some restrictions of
use but fully functional for BC3, and LispWorks
Professional/Educational is a full-scale Lisp programming environment
but not free of charge. The Personal edition is about 100 MB download
for the installer. Do a complete install. You may make an
alias/shortcut to desktop or other favorite place for convenient
starting by clicking. With the Professional version you can make
manupulation easier or create stand-alone applicatons.</li>




  <li>On Windows (not on Mac OSX) you need to install&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">MinGW</span>
(Minimalist GNU for Windows) software in order to have a gcc compiler
that BC3 is using for patch compilation (another choice is&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Cygwin,</span> but
MinGW is simpler.)&nbsp;Click the &lsquo;<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">MinGW-5.1.3</span>&rsquo;
(or later) installer icon
(included in <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">"Support/MinGW-setup"</span>)
when you are connected to Internet, and follow
the instructions to make a base tools installation.&nbsp;If
problems appear in
downloading from the default site, try others. It is assumed that you
install <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">MinGW</span>
to <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">"C:\MinGW"</span>.</li>




  <li>You have downloaded (or need to download) <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">"BC3LW"</span>
software distribution of June 30, 2008, from <a href="http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/software/BlockCompiler/BC3LW180608.zip">http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/software/BlockCompiler/BC3LW300608.zip</a>
to Mac OSX (10.4 and 10.5 tested, both PowerPC and Intel machines) or
Windows (XP tested). Expand the zip file. Move the
directory&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">BC3LW</span>
preferably to the user documents directory (e.g.
/Users/USER/Documents/ on Mac, where USER is your username). If you install it
elsewhere, you need to set the pathname explicitly, see below.&nbsp;</li>




  <li>Start Lisp
and compile BC3LW in the following manner: Open file BC_COMPILE.lisp
(in director BC3LW) and execute menu <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Buffers&gt;Evaluate</span>&nbsp;
on Macontosh or menu <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Works&gt;Buffers&gt;Evaluate</span>
on Windows. It should
compile BC3 without errors. Exit Lisp. BC3 is ready for use.</li>




  <li>You may now use BC3 by first starting Lisp, then opening
file BC_LOAD.lisp and evaluating the buffer. BC3&nbsp;should start
without errors, if all configurations are done
properly.</li>




  <li>When BC3 is successfully running, you may open and execute
the existing demo files (documented in the related report) or write and
execute your own patches.</li>




</ol>




<h3>BC3LW directory management and software update</h3>




<ol>




  <li>If you reinstall or update the <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">BC3LW</span>
software or parts of it, the most important thing is to avoid overwriting
your user files or user settings (in file BC_LOAD.load).</li>




  <li>Subdirectory <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">BC3</span>
inside top-directory <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">BC3LW</span>
includes the source files of BC3 and compiled files after compilation,
as well as some runtime libraries for C and audio support.</li>




  <li>Directory&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">&ldquo;Support&rdquo;</span>
includes documentation and installation instructions (this file),
MATLAB interfacing
support, and MinGW support.</li>




  <li>Demos are in directories <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">"MDEMOS"</span> (for
MATLAB) and <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">"RTDEMOS"</span>
(realtime demos).</li>




  <li>File&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">BC_LOAD.lisp
    </span>includes user-specific settings that you may change if you need.</li>




  <li>You may place your own BC3 files as you wish to manage them
from
Lisp, but the easiest way is to make a directory inside the top-level <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">BC3LW</span>
directory for them. Be careful not to delete them if you update BC3
or parts of it.</li>




</ol>




<h3>BC3LW testing</h3>




<ol>




  <li>Start BC3 after installation, open and execute<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"></span>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">&ldquo;mdemos/dsp/sinosc.lisp&rdquo;</span>
in the Lisp
listener. This should create a sinewave oscillator (as the value of
symbol sinosc) as well as export the model
as an m-file to Matlab (or Octave) to the directory specified in <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">BC_LOAD.lisp</span> (the default is MATLAB inside the BC3 directory). If
you have Matlab (Octave) and you set a
path to the directory mentioned, then you can simply evaluate <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">bc_resp</span> in
Matlab (Octave) to see how the sine oscillator makes a graphical
presentation of the waveform.</li>




  <li>To test a realtime patch and audio-I/O, go to the sine-wave
synthesis case in file "rtdemos/dsp/sine-tone.lisp" as documented in
the
    <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Report.pdf</span>

  <li><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">It
is recommendable to check all the examples in chapter </span><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">"Introduction
to BlockCompiler" to get familiar with BC3 modeling.</span></li>




  <li><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">NOTICE:
This is a version of BC3 under progress, and it has known and unknown
bugs. Feedback of your experience and comments is welcome.<br>
