[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Invokes the [1mCommon Lisp[22m[1] interpreter and compiler\.
       When called without arguments, executes the
       [4mread\-eval\-print[24m [4mloop[24m[2], in which expressions are in
       turn [1mREAD[22m[3] from the standard input, [1mEVAL[22m[4]uated by
       the lisp interpreter, and their results are [1mPRINT[22m[5]ed
       to the standard output\. Invoked with [1m\-c[22m, compiles the
       specified lisp files to a platform\-independent bytecode
       which can be executed more efficiently\.

       [1m\-\-version[0m
           Displays the [1mCLISP[22m[6] version number, as given by
           the function [1mLISP\-IMPLEMENTATION\-VERSION[22m[7], the
           value of the variable [4m*FEATURES*[24m, as well some other
           information\.

       [1m\-help\-image[0m
           Displays information about the memory image being
           invoked: whether is it suitable for scripting as
           well as the [1m:DOCUMENTATION [22msupplied to

       [1m\-B [4m[22mlisp\-lib\-dir[0m
           Specifies the installation directory\. This is the
           directory containing the linking sets and other data
           files\.  Directory [4mlisp\-lib\-dir[24m can be changed
           dynamically using the [4mSYMBOL\-MACRO[24m[10]
           [4m*LIB\-DIRECTORY*[24m\.

       [1m\-M [4m[22mmem\-file[0m
           Specifies the initial memory image\. This must be a
           memory dump produced by the [1mEXT:SAVEINITMEM [22mfunction
           by this [1mclisp [22mruntime\.

       [1m\-m [4m[22mmemory\-size[0m
           Sets the amount of memory [1mCLISP[22m[6] tries to grab on
           startup\. The amount may be given as

           [4mnnnnnnn[0m
               measured in bytes

           [4mnnnn[24m[1mK[0m

           [4mn[24m[1mM[0m
           [4mn[24m[1mMB[0m
               measured in megabytes

           The default is 3 megabytes\.  The argument is
           constrained above 100 KB\.

           This version of [1mCLISP[22m[6] is not likely to actually
           use the entire [4mmemory\-size[24m since
           garbage\-collection will periodically reduce the
           amount of used memory\. It is therefore common to
           specify 10 MB even if only 2 MB are going to be
           used\.

       [1m\-L [4m[22mlanguage[0m
           Specifies the language [1mCLISP[22m[6] uses to communicate
           with the user\. This may be one of [1menglish[22m, [1mgerman[22m,
           [1mfrench[22m, [1mspanish[22m, [1mdutch[22m, [1mrussian[22m, [1mdanish[22m\. Other

           [4mvariable[24m[12] [1mLANG[22m, provided the corresponding
           message catalog is installed\.  The language may be
           changed dynamically using the [4mSYMBOL\-MACRO[24m[10]
           [4mCUSTOM:*CURRENT\-LANGUAGE*[24m\.

       [1m\-N [4m[22mlocale\-dir[0m
           Specifies the base directory of locale files\.
           [1mCLISP[22m[6] will search its message catalogs in
           [4mlocale\-dir/language/LC_MESSAGES/clisp\.mo[24m\. This
           directory may be changed dynamically using the
           [4mSYMBOL\-MACRO[24m[10] [4mCUSTOM:*CURRENT\-LANGUAGE*[24m\.

       [1m\-E[4m[22mdomain[24m [4mencoding[0m
           Specifies the encoding used for the given domain,

           Warning
           Note that the values of these [4mSYMBOL\-MACRO[24m[10]s
           that have been saved in a memory image are ignored:
           these [4mSYMBOL\-MACRO[24m[10]s are reset based on the OS
           environment [1mafter [22mthe memory image is loaded\. You
           have to use the RC file, [4mCUSTOM:*INIT\-HOOKS*[24m or
           init function to set them on startup, but it is best
           to set the aforementioned [4menvironment[24m [4mvariable[24m[12]s
           appropriately for consistency with other programs\.

           [1mNIL[22m[16], as per [ANSI CL standard]\. The first [1m\-q[0m
           removes the banner and the good\-bye message, the
           second sets variables [4m*LOAD\-VERBOSE*[24m[13] and

           the second sets [4mCUSTOM:*LOAD\-ECHO*[24m to [1mT[22m[15]\. These

           [4mCUSTOM:*ANSI*[24m to [1mT[22m[15]\.

       [1m\-traditional[0m
           Traditional: reverses the residual effects of [1m\-ansi[0m
           in the saved memory image\.

       [1m\-modern[0m
           Provides a modern view of symbols: at startup the
           [4m*PACKAGE*[24m[27] variable will be set to the
           "CS\-COMMON\-LISP\-USER" package, and the
           [4m*PRINT\-CASE*[24m[28] will be set to [1m:DOWNCASE[22m\. This
           has the effect that symbol lookup is case\-sensitive
           (except for keywords and old\-style packages) and
           that keywords and uninterned symbols are printed
           with lower\-case preferrence\. See Section 11.4,
           "Package Case-Sensitivity"\.

       [1m\-p [4m[22mpackage[0m
           At startup the value of the variable [4m*PACKAGE*[24m[27]
           will be set to the package named [4mpackage[24m\. The
           default is the value of [4m*PACKAGE*[24m[27] when the image
           was saved, normally [4m"COMMON\-LISP\-USER"[24m[29]\.

       [1m\-C[0m
           Compile when loading: at startup the value of the
           variable [4mCUSTOM:*LOAD\-COMPILING*[24m will be set to
           [1mT[22m[15]\. Code being [1mLOAD[22m[30]ed will then be
           [1mCOMPILE[22m[31]d on the fly\. This results in slower
           loading, but faster execution\.

       [1m\-norc[0m
           Normally [1mCLISP[22m[6] loads the user [4m"run[24m [4mcontrol"[0m

           [4m\.clisprc\.lisp[24m or [4m\.clisprc\.fas[24m in the home
           directory [1mUSER\-HOMEDIR\-PATHNAME[22m[33], whichever is
           newer\. This option, [1m\-norc[22m, prevents loading of the
           RC file\.

       [1m\-i [4m[22minit\-file[0m
           Specifies initialization files to be [1mLOAD[22m[30]ed at
           startup\. These should be lisp files (source or
           compiled)\. Several [1m\-i [22moptions can be given; all
           the specified files will be loaded in order\.

           expressions will be output to

           processing done by the shell, the [4mexpressions[24m must
           be enclosed in double quotes, and double quotes and
           backslashes must be escaped with backslashes\.

           loaded, the variable [4mEXT:*ARGS*[24m will be bound to a
           list of strings, representing the [4margument[24ms\.  If
