This is GNU CLISP, an ANSI Common Lisp implementation.


What is LISP?
-------------

LISP is a general purpose programming language.
It was invented by J. McCarthy in 1959.
There have been many dialects of it, but nowadays LISP has been standardized
and wide-spread due to the industrial standard ANSI COMMON LISP. There are
applications in the domains of symbolic knowledge processing (AI), numerical
mathematics (MACLISP yielded numerical code as good as FORTRAN), and
widely used programs like editors (EMACS) and CAD (AUTOCAD).
There are introductions to the language:

For experts: This standard text has emerged into an ANSI standard, which
you can get free of charge from

LISP is run in an interactive environment. You input forms, and they will be
evaluated at once. Thus you can inspect variables, call functions with given
arguments or define your own functions.

   install.bat,
   src/install.lisp       user-friendly installer


and - to your convenience, if you like reading source -

   src/*.lisp             the source of lispinit.mem
   src/*.fas              the same files, already compiled


Installation:
-------------

Change the strings in src/config.lisp, using a text editor.
Then start

         clisp.exe

When the LISP prompt

      [1]> _

appears, type

      (without-package-lock ()
        (compile-file "src/config.lisp")
        (load "src/config.fas"))

and then

        (saveinitmem)

to overwrite the file lispinit.mem with your configuration. Then

        (exit)

If you want a minimal install, then create a directory, and put the
executable and the memory image there.
Assuming D:\GNU\CLISP :

   mkdir d:\gnu\clisp
   copy lisp.exe d:\gnu\clisp
   copy lispinit.mem d:\gnu\clisp

And create a shortcut file to the main driver clisp.exe.
You can also use file install.bat which creates the driver file
on your desktop and sets up the registry.


When you encounter problems:
----------------------------

After errors, you are in the debugger:

     Break 1 [2]> _

You can evaluate forms, as usual. Furthermore:

     Help
               prints context-sensitive help
     Abort     or
     Unwind
               climbs up to the next higher input loop
     Backtrace
               shows the contents of the stack, helpful for debugging

And you can look at the values of the variables of the functions where the
error occurred.

Please accompany it with the CLISP version, which you get by calling
(lisp-implementation-version), as well as the OS name and version.
